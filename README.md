Hi, my name is Sofie. I'm a visual artist, creative coder, and aspiring Full-Stack Web Developer based in Germany.
I'm excited about anything liberated and open: open technology, liberated people, culture, and content. 
I'm interested in Linux, FLOSS, and the open, decentralized web.
My goal is to contribute something useful, enjoyable and beautiful. 
Whatever I create, I want to ensure that people can review, learn from, modify, and freely share it - allowing us all to profit and grow together.

-> this is my GitHub Mirror. I mainly use Codeberg, a non-profit alternative for FLOSS projects.
